      "answerExplanation": "An entry point in a Java application consists of a main() method with a single String[] argument, return type of void, and modifiers public and static. The name of the variable in the input argument does not matter. Option A is missing the static modifier, Option B is missing the String[] argument, and Option C has the wrong access modifier and method name. Only Option D fulfills these requirements. Note that the modifier final is optional and may be added to an entry point method."
